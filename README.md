<h1>Hjelmar Ticketing System</h1>
<p>This is a system I created for friends and family to send me any IT/computer issues without the need to call me. My plan is to sift through the tickets as they come in and prioritize them based on level of severity. This is my first project that I've decided to tackle head on and will continue to work on it as long as I find it interesting and possibly useful.</p>

<h3>Python and Streamlit.</h3>
<p>The main program being used for this is Python and Streamlit. I really enjoy Python as my first language, and messing around with GUI programming satisfies my desire to click the screen and attempt to make things as user-friendly as possible.</p>
